This is just a very simple macro I made for myself for Bee Swarm Simulator

It clicks WASD at an interval of 1 second (changeable)

And clicks Left Click at an interval of 0.1 second (changeable)

You can also toggle whether the keyboard or mouse is active

Keybinds:
F1 - Start
F2 - Stop

**NOTE**: This overrides your mouse and keyboard. So wherever you point your text cursor, it will type WASD. Same as where you point your mouse, it will keep clicking.
